CONDITION ONE
*Simple*
It's usually more useful to observe probability features.

*Complex*
Usually the best action is to observe a probability feature, but there are some exceptions. For example, if you see that two options both have high probability (around 0.9), you're most likely going to choose one of them so it's best to see which has the higher payoff. Also for some trials where the options are similar, finding the worst option so you can avoid it is a better use of your observations than finding the best option so you can choose it. If you run out of observations and have to choose between options with observed features and unobserved features, you should choose 'as if' the unobserved probabilities are about .5 and the unobserved payoffs are about 20.


CONDITION TWO
*Simple*
It's usually more useful to observe payout features.

*Complex*
Usually the best action is to observe a payout feature, but there are some exceptions. For example, if you see that two options both have a high payout (around 100), you're most likely going to choose one of them so it's best to see which has the higher probability. Also for some trials where the options are similar, finding the worst option so you can avoid it is a better use of your observations than finding the best option so you can choose it. If you run out of observations and have to choose between options with observed features and unobserved features, you should choose `as if' the unobserved probabilities are about 0.5 and the unobserved payoffs are about 50.
